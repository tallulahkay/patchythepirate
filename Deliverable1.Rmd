## Abstract

## Data Description

## Research Question
What is the effect of different country factors, such as population and gdp, and age of individuals on suicide rate within the past three decades.

## Data Import & Cleaning
Data import of the main 'suicide' dataset was succesful, with only the 'HDI/year' having a number of missing values for each country and year. 

## Variation of Single Variables

## Covariation between Multiple Variables
